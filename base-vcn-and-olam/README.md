Terraform stack spins up an VCN and a compute node with public IP that I use to run Ansible scripts over the other labs.
I use this compute instance also as a stepping stone to enter all my other labs so I can spin them up with primave IPs only.

Note: the optimal solution would be to add a Bastion host, please don't use this stack for anything important :-)
